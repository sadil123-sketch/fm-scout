# FM Scout

A Vite + React setup for the FM Genie Scout prototype UI. The project packages the existing JSX prototype into a runnable web app with Tailwind CSS and lucide-react icons.

## Getting started
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Build for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

The main prototype lives in `src/App.jsx` and renders the UI demonstrated in the original `fm-genie-scout-prototype.jsx` file.
